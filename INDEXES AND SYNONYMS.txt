INDEXES AND SYNONYMS - send to lobotomik

Indexes
- logically and physically independed
- unique indexes - UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY
- nonunique indexes - usermade indexes f.e. FOREIGN KEY
- the table must be in your own schema
- INDEX privilege on the table 
- CREATE ANY INDEX system privilege
- should be created if
the column contains a wide range of values
column contains a large number of nulls
one or more coulmns are frequently used together in a WHERE or join condition
the table is so large that most queries are expected to retrieve less than 2-4%

- creating index syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name(column...., column)

COMPOSITE INDEX
- a.k.a concatenated 
- created on multiple columns in a table
- Null values are not included
- can create an index on the FOREIGN KEY 
- not used if index is NULL in WHERE clause

CONFIRMING INDEXES

- USER_INDEXES, USER_IND_COLUMNS
- syntax
SELECT DISTINCT ic.index_name, ic.column_name, ic.column_position, id.uniqueness
FROM user_indexes id, user_ind_columns ic
WHERE id.table_name = ic.table_name
and ic.table_name = 'EMPLOYEES'
- NO MODIFYING DROP THAT SHIT DOWN, YOU MESS UP YOU REDO
-- DROP INDEX name

FUNCTION-BASED INDEXES
- defined with the UPPER or LOWER function or any valid built-in function f.e. TO_CHAR
- syntax
CREATE INDEX upp_last_name
ON employees (UPPER(last_name));


SYNONYM
- used to simplify access to objects by crating another name for the object
- cannot be contained in a package
- private must be distinct from all other objects owned by the same user
- CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM privilege - otherwise no no
- CREATE [PUBLIC] SYNONYM synonym
FOR object;

CREATE SYNONYM name
for object;

to confirm
- query USER_SYNONYMS
