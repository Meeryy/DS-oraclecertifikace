- ends with 
COMMIT or ROLLBACK

A DCL (GRANT or REVOKE)
a user exits normally from the Oracle Database utility - causes the current transaction to be implicitly commited

READ CONSISTENCY
- readers do no viw data that is in the process of being changed


COMMIT, ROLLBACK and SAVEPOINT

- SAVEPOINT creates a point in a transaction to which we can rollback without having to undo the entire transaction
