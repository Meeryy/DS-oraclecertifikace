DML Operations and Views

- it is possible to INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE information even if it results in a row no longer being part of the view

Data access control
- WITH CHECK OPTION ONLY
- WITH READ ONLY

CHECK Option

- syntax
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW


- you can create a view if the subquery contains an inline view

DELETING A VIEWS

- DROP VIEW view


INLINE VIEWS
- subqueries in the FROM clause
- simplifies complex queries by removing join operations and condensing several queries into one

- syntax
SELECT e.lname, e.salary, e.department,d.maxsal
FROM employees w, (SELECT d_id, max(salary), maxsal
FROM employees
GROUP BY d_id) d
WHERE e.d_id = department_id
AND e.salary = d.maxsal;

TOP-N-ANALYSIS
- ranks results
- top 5 records or top-n-records of a result set returned by a query
- uses an inline view to return a result set
- ROWNUM to assign a row number to the result set
- syntax

SELECT ROWNUM AS "Longest employed", last_name,hire_date 
FROM (SELECT last_name,hide_date
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date)
WHERE ROWNUM <=5;
